# Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture  in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

# Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

# Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

This is a notebook for my data science journey. Things get hard really quick and sometimes I need to reread a paragraph multiples times to understand a short passage although my English is not that bad (or is it really bad? I only binge romantic novels...) So... I made a notebook. And the theme is extremely beautiful too, I thought flexing my CV in this aethestic would make me look cool and smart. 

I try to write about topics I learn in the easiest way possible, so my soft and lineless brain could digest it later. No knowledge here is mine to claim, I often share works of other authors that I find interesting and easy to understand. Free feel to share my post and use it in academic circumstances (or joke about and mock it idk, whatever is useful to you). Kindly let me know if I was dumb somewhere, but don't be too hard 'cause my heart is fragile hahahaha...

I like to do oil painting in my freetime (if I have freetime at all?). Sometimes I will post some pictures. Want to purchase them so I can spend more money on meaningless things? Please contact me really fast. 

Haha, I have ranted enough. No more nonsense, happy reading !
