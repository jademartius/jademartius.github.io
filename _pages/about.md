This is a notebook for my `data science` journey. Things get hard really quick and sometimes I need to reread a paragraph *multiple times* to understand a short passage although my English is not that bad *(or is it really bad? I only binge romantic novels...)* So... I made a notebook. And the theme is extremely beautiful too, I thought flexing my CV in this aethestic would make me look cool and smart. 

I try to write about topics I learn in the easiest way possible, so my soft and lineless brain could digest it later. No knowledge here is mine to claim, I often share works of other authors I find interesting and easy to understand. Free feel to share my posts and use them in academic circumstances *(or joke about it and mock it idk, whatever is useful to you)*. Kindly let me know if I was dumb somewhere, but don't be too hard 'cause my heart is fragile hahahaha...
