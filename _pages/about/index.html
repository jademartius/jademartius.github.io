<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>This is a notebook for my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">data science</code> journey. Things get hard really quick and sometimes I need to reread a paragraph <em>multiple times</em> to understand a short passage although my English is not that bad <em>(or is it really bad? I only binge romantic novels…)</em> So… I made a notebook. And the theme is extremely beautiful too, I thought flexing my CV in this aethestic would make me look cool and smart.</p> <p>I try to write about topics I learn in the easiest way possible, so my soft and lineless brain could digest it later. No knowledge here is mine to claim, I often share works of other authors I find interesting and easy to understand. Free feel to share my posts and use them in academic circumstances <em>(or joke about it and mock it idk, whatever is useful to you)</em>. Kindly let me know if I was dumb somewhere, but don’t be too hard ‘cause my heart is fragile hahahaha…</p> </body></html>
